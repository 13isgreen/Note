# Note
A collection of Notes like a second brain 

this is my attempt to refactor all my notes from my time as a CS student in order to review and create a more managable organized system to pass along to others
im using typst which at the current time (jan 2025) is relativly new and more feture rich and hommy feeling than latex. Many of my prev notes are scattered between multiple sources
physical notebooks, virtual notebooks, overleaf (an online latex compiler). During colledge i could never make up my mind on which type of note taking i perfered.
This being said these will sometimes be included in the file with the new typst notes but should mostly be disregarded and are just there for me to make quick refrence of whilis refactoring.
