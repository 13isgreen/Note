= Turning Machines
  - A turing machine is a finite automata with an infinite tape that is used as memory
  - it differs from other finite automa becuase it is read and write as oppose to read only
  - turning machine tape is infinite
  - final state are immediately final

= Algorithms and the Church-Turing Thesis
