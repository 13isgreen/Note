= Turning Machines
  - A turing machine is a finite automata with an infinite tape that is used as memory
  - it differs from other finite automa becuase it is read and write as oppose to read only
  - turning machine tape is infinite
  - final state are immediately final
  -

  = How it works

   The tape can move 1 unit to the left or right depending on the input
  = Example 
  #show list: set text(gray)
  - $ B = {w\#w | w in {1,0}*}$
  So we want to ensure that the the accepted string is replicated and seperated by a \# symbol. The turing machine does this by 
  #show list: set text(black)
